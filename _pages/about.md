 A Beijing native turned international adventurer, I began my high school journey in the US and am now graduating from UM with a major in CS and a side of minor. Next up: UIUC for my master's in CS! Passionate about cooking, fitness, and travel, I enjoy exploring new flavors and places with my trusty French Bulldog. A proud Netflix aficionado, I'm seeking a summer SDE internship that combines my tech-savvy with a dash of fun. Let's create code that makes an impact!
