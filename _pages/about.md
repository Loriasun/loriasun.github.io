 A Beijing native turned international adventurer, I began my high school journey in the US and am now graduating from UM with a major in CS and a side of minor. Next up: UIUC for my master's in CS! Passionate about cooking, fitness, and travel, I enjoy exploring new flavors and places with my trusty French Bulldog. A proud Netflix aficionado, I'm seeking a summer SDE internship that combines my tech-savvy with a dash of fun. Let's create code that makes an impact!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
