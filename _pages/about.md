 A Beijing native turned international adventurer, I embarked on my high school journey in the US and recently graduated from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, majoring in CS with a minor in Math. My academic journey continues at UIUC, where I'm pursuing my master's in CS.

During the summer of 2023, I had the privilege of interning at Schlumberger as a Backend Developer. There, I utilized technologies such as gRPC, C#, Python, and Protobuf. I followed an agile approach to develop a gRPC bridge between C# .NET backend and Machine Learning applications, which boosted data transfer rates by 30% and supported real-time processing in Petrel, a leading geoscience software. My efforts led to a 70% compatibility rate by Protobuf transcoding with 'Ocean for Petrel' objects, ensuring seamless and asynchronous data transitions. This significantly reduced data integration issues for end-users. Additionally, I deployed the Petrel plugin using Docker files and Kubernetes templates, scaling its use to over 500 engineers.

Outside of my professional life, I'm passionate about cooking, fitness, and travel. I love exploring new flavors and places, accompanied by my trusty French Bulldog. As a proud Netflix aficionado, I'm currently seeking a summer SDE internship for 2024 that combines my tech-savvy with a dash of fun. Let's collaborate and create code that makes a genuine impact!
